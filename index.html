                <h2>dear maria!</h2>
                <p>In the summer, I was at a camp where the food was very delicious. There was also a small shop that sold little toys, drinks, chips, crackers, and various sweets.

                    The food in the cafeteria was very tasty, for example, cutlets with potatoes or some kind of soup.
                    
                    I remember that in the morning, we went to the cafeteria, had breakfast, and got ready for a hike. During the hike, we swam in the river, and on the way back, we decided to stop, and they cooked us pilaf. The pilaf was very delicious.
                    
                    After the hike, we returned to our group, took a shower, and went to bed, but in the evening, we still went to the disco.
